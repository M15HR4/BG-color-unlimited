# BG-color-unlimited
This JavaScript code creates a simple color-changing background feature for a webpage. The functionality is initiated by two buttons: "Start" and "Stop."

Start Button:

When the "Start" button is clicked, it triggers a process that changes the background color of the entire webpage every second.
The color changes are random, creating a dynamic and visually appealing experience.
If the "Start" button is clicked while the color-changing process is already active, it doesn't interfere.


Stop Button:

The "Stop" button, when clicked, halts the color-changing process.
If the "Stop" button is clicked while the color-changing process is not active, it has no effect.
This interactive feature adds a touch of creativity to the webpage, allowing users to enjoy a continuously evolving background color. It provides a simple and engaging visual experience that can be controlled at the user's convenience using the "Start" and "Stop" buttons.
